The adword test pages all live in the following folder:
    adwords/templates/adwords

-~=[ CAMPAIGN LANDING PAGES ]=~-

Every adword campaign landing page has a corresponding URL. For example,
the following adword test page and url are a pair:

    adwords/templates/adwords/pandora.html
    http://localhost:8000/a/t/pandora/

There are three things to note about the URL:
    1. the final part of the URL, 'pandora', matches the tmeplate page name
    2. the URL does NOT include '.html'
    3. the middle part of the URL, 'a/t', is constant

-~=[ LANDING PAGE TEMPLATES ]=~-

Each adword test page should extend landing_page_base.html:
    {% extends 'adwords/landing_page_base.html' %}
    
The adwords base template extends 'adwords/superbase.html'.

All landing pages are located in:
    adwords/templates/adwords/landing_pages/

Each adword landing page can contain blocks from the landing page base.

Some blocks are links to action pages. The links should live in 
landing_page_base.html; the landing pages simply provide the content.

-~=[ CLICK TO PAGES ]=~-

Click to pages open when users click links on the landing page, such as
"Find out more", the main image, and action buttons.

Click to templates are located in:
    adwords/templates/adwords/click_to/

Currently, these templates are all empty.

Each template page should extend click_to_page_base.html:
    {% extends 'adwords/click_to_page_base.html' %}

-~=[ DONE PAGE ]=~-

The done page opens after users submit their email address, both from an 
adwords landing page or click to page.

The done template is located at:
    adwords/templates/adwords/download_page.html


-~=[ EMAIL ]=~-

An email is automatically sent to users after they submit their email address.

The email template is located at:
    adwords/templates/adwords/email.txt
