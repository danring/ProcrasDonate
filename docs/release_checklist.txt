A release is a bundle of "extension" code changes pushed to the live
site. This may include an xpi of the Firefox extension and/or the Django
procrasdonate app. The latter is part of the ProcrasDonate "extension"
because of the literal extension's interaction with server web pages and
css.

"Extension" code should never be pushed live without a release.

@TODO : move necessary css from the server to the extension so that the
website can be updated (mostly) separate from the extension.

Every release should go through the following checklist:

=== ProcrasDonate Firefox extension ===

install.rdf
 * Incremented version numbers from v to v'.

main.js
 * Add do_install_<v'> and do_upgrade_<v'> logic
   * Evolve data base schema if necessary

views.js
   * add state changes to ACCOUNT and STATE defaults.

=== procrasdonate Django app ===

 new template files
 * Create after_install_<v'> and after_upgrade_<v'>

 generate xpi
   cd procrasdonate/ff_extn/ProcrasDonate; zip -r ../../../media/xpi/ProcrasDonate_<v'>.xpi *

 generate hash
   sha1sum ../../../media/xpi/ProcrasDonate_0.1.2.xpi 

 snippets/banner.html
 * Update link to xpi
 * update hash value 

 record all changes in docs/release_changes_<v'>.txt
