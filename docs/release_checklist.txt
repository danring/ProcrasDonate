An *extension* release is an XPI zip of the extension code base:
    <repo root>/procrasdonate/ff_extn/ProcrasDonate

A *server* release is a particular commit of everything else:
    the enclosing Django project and procrasdonate app.
    
Although some server releases may occur independent of an extension release, much
of this sysytem works together. Backwards compatibility must be considered in that
users will update their extensions asynchronously.

@TODO : move necessary css from the server to the extension so that the
website can be updated (mostly) separate from the extension.
#@TODO: make procrasdonate django app and ProcrasDonate ff extn more separated and stand-alone.

Every release should go through the following checklist:

=== ProcrasDonate Firefox extension ===

install.rdf
 * Incremented version numbers from v to v'.

main.js
 * Add do_install_<v'> and do_upgrade_<v'> logic
   * Evolve data base schema if necessary

views.js
   * add state changes to ACCOUNT and STATE defaults.
     -- or should every call to a variable just use the settings.DEFAULT for default?

=== procrasdonate Django app ===

 new template files
 * Create after_install_<v'> and after_upgrade_<v'>

 generate xpi
   cd procrasdonate/ff_extn/ProcrasDonate; zip -r ../../../media/xpi/ProcrasDonate_<v'>.xpi *

 generate hash
   sha1sum ../../../media/xpi/ProcrasDonate_0.1.2.xpi 

 snippets/banner.html
 * Update link to xpi
 * update hash value 

 record all changes in docs/release_changes_<v'>.txt
