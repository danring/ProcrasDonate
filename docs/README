##### USEFUL BASH ALIASES:

## set python path to current working directory
## (there are other ways to do this. you'll need to do 
## something in order for xpi_it, for example, to work)
PYTHONPATH=./

## replace with your path to repo
export REPO="/Users/lucy/sandbox/CalmProcrasDonate/"

## creates xpi file from ff_extn/ProcrasDonate and places in media/xpi 
alias xpi_it='python ${REPO}procrasdonate/applib/xpi_builder.py'

## rebuilds extension templates. you will still need to reload chrome to see changes
alias rebuild='python ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/bin/build_templates.py ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/templates/*.html; cat ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/templates/*.js > ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/js/templates/all.js'
