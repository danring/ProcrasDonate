##### USEFUL BASH ALIASES:

## set python path to current working directory
## (there are other ways to do this. you'll need to do 
## something in order for xpi_it, for example, to work)
PYTHONPATH=./
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="settings"

## replace with your path to repo
export REPO="/Users/lucy/sandbox/CalmProcrasDonate/"

## creates update xpi file from ff_extn/ProcrasDonate and places in media/xpi 
alias xpi_it='python ${REPO}procrasdonate/applib/xpi_builder.py'

## rebuilds extension templates. you will still need to reload chrome to see changes
alias rebuild='python ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/bin/build_templates.py ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/templates/*.html; cat ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/templates/*.js > ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/js/templates/all.js'

## compiles javascript files in overlay_list.txt into single namespaced file, generated_javascript.js
alias generate_js='python ${REPO}procrasdonate/ProcrasDonateFFExtn/content/bin/safe_globals.py'

## does everything above
alias everything='rebuild; generate_js; xpi_it'

## does production things
alias pd_live='everything; ./manage.py migrate; chown -hR www-data:www-data ${REPO}; /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload'

##### SOUTH DATABASE SCHEMA AND DATA MIGRATIONS

./manage.py startmigration procrasdonate XXX-migrationname-XXX --auto

then run

./manage.py migrate procrasdonate

to roll back to a specific migration:

./manage.py migration procrasdonate XXX-migrationname-XXX

note that column removal fails in sqlite3. when roll forward, south will complain about the 
duplicate column. just comment out the forward function line, roll forward, then uncomment.
