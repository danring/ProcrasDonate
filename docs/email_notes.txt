       if settings.DJANGO_SERVER:
            print "="*60
            print "FROM:", from_email
            print "TO:", to_email
            print "SUBJECT:", subject
            print "MESSAGE:", message
        else:
            from django.core.mail import send_mail
            send_mail(subject, message, from_email, [to_email])

    client = Client(url, cache=None)
    credentials = client.factory.create('ns0:loginArgs')
    credentials.username='clay@bilumi.org'
    credentials.password='ravenraven'
