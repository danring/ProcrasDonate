<p>User registration streamlined into just 4 steps</p>
<p><em>My Progress</em> page enhancements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Classify websites by entering them directly in the <em>Classifications</em> tab</li>
	<li>New <em>Visits</em> tab that shows all of your page visits for the day</li>
</ul>
<p>Time tracking halts when computer goes to sleep  
	and resumes, if Firefox is the active application, when computer wakes up :-)</p>
<p>Fixed bug in which flash was not being detected on currently viewed webpage,
	thus the user needed only to be idle for 3 minutes for time tracking to halt.
	With the fix, pages that contain flash halt time tracking once the user
	is idle for 20 minutes. See the development blog post on 
	<a href="http://proudlyprocrasdonating.wordpress.com/2009/12/05/time-tracker-sleuthing/">
	How we track website visits</a> for more time tracking details.</p> 
<p>Fixed toolbar icon bug in which times over 24 hours were reported incorrectly.</p>
