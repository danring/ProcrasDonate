<p>Feature: View web page visits on the "Visits" tab of MY PROGRESS</p>
<p>Feature :-) Time tracking halts when computer goes to sleep, 
	and resumes, if Firefox is the active application, when computer wakes up</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fixed bug in which flash was never being detected on currently viewed webpage,
	thus the user needed only to be idle for 3 minutes for time tracking to halt.
	With the fix, pages that contain flash halt time tracking once the user
	is idle for 20 minutes. See the development blog post on
