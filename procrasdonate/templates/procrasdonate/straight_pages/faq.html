		<h2><a name="benefits"></a>How can ProcrasDonate help me?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/StackPennies.png" class="small-image">		
		<p>Want to waste less time noodling around on the internet?
			ProcrasDonate's <b>feel-good</b> incentive and <b>custom</b> feedback can help.
		But that's not all.  
		</p>
		<p>
		ProcrasDonate is also a <b>fun</b> way to organize your charitable donations and build lasting relationships with your favorite non-profits.
		</p>
		<p>Want to support <b>quality</b> online content?  
		You can also set up a TimeWellSpent donation to pay the websites you care about for the time you spend using them.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a name="how"></a>What do I do?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/ScratchHead.png" class="small-image">		
		<p>First add our <b>free</b> software to your web browser.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Then go through the registration process: you'll use your <b>existing</b> Amazon.com account to set up whatever charitable incentive is right for you.
		</p>
		<p><b>Sorting</b> your websites into ProcrasDonation or TimeWellSpent is as easy as clicking on the question mark that will appear at the top of your web browser.
		</p>
		<p>The ProcrasDonation <b>meter</b> next to the sorting icon is based on <b>your</b> weekly goals and limits.  
		When the meter bars start turning <b>red</b> then you've procrastinated more than you want to for this week.
		</p>

		<h2><a name="donations"></a>How do donations work?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/DollarRocket.png" class="small-image">		
		<p>
		Every hour you spend on websites you've marked as ProcrasDonation is a pledge to your selected <b>charities</b>.  
		You can change your pledge amounts on your <b>'my settings'</b> page.
		</p>
		<p>Every hour you spend on websites you've marked as TimeWellSpent is a pledge to the website's content <b>provider</b>.
		</p>
		<p>Whenever one of your pledges reaches a threshold of $10 then a donation is made <b>directly and in full</b> from your Amazon account to the intended recipient.
		Your <b>voluntary</b> transaction fees and <b>voluntary</b> monthly payments are treated as pledges and paid to ProcrasDonate.com at the $10 threshold.
		</p>
		<p>Your <b>'my impact'</b> page on our website, which can only be seen on your own computer, keeps track of your donations to date.
		<p><b>If</b> you like, then our system will send you weekly emails on your time management <b>progress</b> and updates on our service.
		</p>
			
		<h2><a name="privacy"></a>Is my browsing confidential?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/FireWall.png" class="small-image">		
		<p><b>Yes!</b> Privacy is important to us. 
		Your can track your complete browsing data on your own computer.  
		But we only store <b>anonymous</b> statistical data in order to measure our community impact.		
		</p> 
		
		<h2><a name="time"></a>What is tracked? Is it always recording? Is there a private browsing mode?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/FireWall.png" class="small-image">		
		<p><b>ProcrasDonate only tracks the webpage you are currently using.</b></p>
		<p>
		Only a single tab from a single window is tracked at any one time. When you have multiple
		tabs and windows, the ProcrasDonate clock is only running on the one you are actually viewing.</p>
		<p>
		ProcrasDonate <em>stops recording</em> when any of the following occur:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You start using a different application, such as Outlook or Photoshop</li>
			<li>You close Firefox</li>
			<li>You put your computer to sleep (this often occurs when you close a laptop)</li>
			<li>You stop using your computer for a little while, which means no keyboard keys pressed,
				no mouse clicks or scrolling and no mouse movement.<br /><br />On webpages without flash,
				ProcrasDonate stops recording after 3 minutes of idle time. On webpages with flash,
				ProcrasDonate stops recording after 20 minutes.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Finally, ProcrasDonate <strong>honors Firefox's Private Browsing Mode</strong>.
			When in Private Browsing Mode, no webpage visits are recorded.</p>
		<p>You can enable and disable Private Browsing Mode through the Firefox <em>Tools</em>
			menu at the top of the screen. You can also use the keyboard shortcut shown next
			to <em>"Tools"->"Start Private Browsing"</em>...something like <em>shift-ctrl-P</em>
			on Windows and <em>shift-apple-P</em> on Macs.

		<h2><a name="email"></a>Will I get lots of junk mail?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/ScratchHead.png" class="small-image">			
		<p>We <b>do not</b> give out your email address.  
		<b>Not even</b> to the organizations you are donating to.
		We will send you occasional thank you notes and year end updates from the charities you support unless you choose not to receive them.
		</p>		
				
		<h2><a name="habits"></a>How can I procrastinate less?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/ToolBelt.png" class="small-image">		
		</p><p>Three techniques have been shown to help people avoid procrastination: 
		<b>Goal Setting</b> (breaking down projects into achievable steps), <b>Stimulus Control</b> (separating work environment from distractions), and <b>Routines</b> (establishing a comfortable schedule.)  
		ProcrasDonate allows you to set your own <i>Goals</i>, track your online distractions (<i>Stimulus Control</i>), and create boundaries on your online <i>Routine</i>.
		</p>
		<p>However, ProcrasDonate is not a medical treatment.  
		<b>Consult</b> your therapist or doctor before incorporating it into a clinical routine.
		</p>

		<h2><a name="learn"></a>Can I find out more?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/ToolBelt.png" class="small-image">		
		</p><p>We try to share as much information as we can find about procrastination on our <b>blog</b>.
				Check it out: http://procrasdonate.wordpress.com/
		</p>
		
		<h2><a name="T-shirts"></a>Can I make a suggestion? 
		</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/ProcrasDonateShirt.png" class="small-image">		
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/ProcrasDonateShirtDetail.png" class="screenshot-long">		
		<p>Please! We want to adapt our system to meet your needs.  
		So use our <b><a target="_blank" href="http://feedback.procrasdonate.com">feedback</a></b> link on the left hand of every page to tell us what you think.
		We'll send you a <i>hand screened organic cotton work of art</i> as a thank you!  
		</p>
	
		<h2><a name="changes"></a>How do I get updates?</h2>
		<p>You'll automatically receive add-on <b>updates</b> as we add new features.
			When Firefox asks if you want to install updates, click yes.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a name="stop"></a>How do I stop using it?</h2>
		<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/StopSign.png" class="small-image">		
		<p>To disable or uninstall this add-on use the FireFox menu "Tools -> Adds-on".</p>
		<p>Disabling is like turning this add-on off. The data remains, but your surfing 
			behavior is no longer tracked. You will also be unable to access your progress,
			impact or settings while this add-on is disabled.</p>
		<p>Uninstalling this add-on may permanently delete 
			your browsing and donating history. You can still view donations by logging
			into your Amazon payments account.</p>
