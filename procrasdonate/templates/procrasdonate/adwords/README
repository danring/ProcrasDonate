The adword test pages all live in the following folder:
    procrasdonate/templates/procrasdonate/adwords

-~=[ TEST PAGE URLS ]=~-

Every adword test page has a corresponding URL. For example,
the following adword test page and url are a pair:

    procrasdonate/templates/procrasdonate/adwords/pandora.html
    http://localhost:8000/t/pandora/

There are three things to note about the URL:
    1. the final part of the URL, 'pandora', matches the tmeplate page name
    2. the URL does NOT include '.html'
    3. the middle part of the URL, 't', is constant

-~=[ TEMPLATE ]=~-

Each adword test page should extend adwords_base.html:
    {% extends 'procrasdonate/adwords/adwords_base.html' %}
    
The adwords base template does not extend any other page. It is located at:
    procrasdonate/templates/procrasdonate/adwords/adwords_base.html

Each adword test page should contain the following blocks:
    {% block descriptive_text %}
        <p>I am descriptive text</p>
    {% endblock %}

    {% block screen_shot %}
        <img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/adword_screenshots/pandora.png" />
    {% endblock %}

    {% block advertising_text_1 %}
        <p>I am advertising text</p>

    {% block advertising_text_2 %}
        <p>I am different advertising text</p>
    {% endblock %}
