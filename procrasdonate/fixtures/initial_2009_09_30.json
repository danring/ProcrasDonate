I am extremely fortunate to have inherited a thriving institution in early 2005 from previous IPI Presidents - Major General Rikhye, the Honorable Olara Otunnu and, in particular, my immediate predecessor, Ambassador David Malone - who made IPI a fixture in United Nations circles and beyond.<br>As a policy research institute, our core goal is to inform decision-makers in government and the UN of trends and dynamics in peace and security and provide them with realistic policy recommendations. We do so by generating policy-relevant research and by channeling expert advice from all over the world into the UN system. Our publications are also of much broader relevance, often appearing in university teaching curricula, academic research papers, and media commentary. In this way, IPI's research contributes to a broader debate on the role of the United Nations in today's world.",
