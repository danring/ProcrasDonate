====< Hooking things up to run >====

Go to app:views:main.py
find the section that tells the appropriate template what to do.  find what it's called by looking in main_urls.py
then change the name of the template that is called.

three parts to how this system calls things:  url - function - template
to change the mapping tween
find function (which lives in app/views(likely in main.py) and change what templates are called
app/urls.py is which functions are called by urls.  (but in urls.py there is some misdirection to other specific sections.)


==================  Checking changes ++++

right click on whole app and choose compare with latest from repository.  see what changes are made.

---------------------- the templates folder is where things are called from.  so when you extend things you do user/filenamehtml etc.-----

===== finding variables ===========

check on spec wiki page first
then on debug toolbar -> env/clay/settings.py   -> set Debug_Toolbar to True
Then in the outline folder (do a text search in Eclipse) find db/user.py and db/graph.py, etc

===== when getting an email ====
it'll appear in the console section (below).  Paste the link into browser to see where it leads.
