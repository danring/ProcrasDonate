<h1>Approving payments</h1>
<p>Your final step is to approve payments on your existing Amazon.com 
	account.  
</p>
<p>Payments to registered 501c3 non-profits will be fully tax deductible.
	<br>Payments will be fully refundable up to 30 days after they are made.
	<br>No one else will be able to make payments on your behalf. </p>
<p>Click on ''Go to Amazon to approve payments'' when you are ready.</p>

<h2>Determining an overall limit</h2>
<p>How often do you want to have to re-authorize payments for your account?</p>
<p><input
	type="text"
	id="a"
	name="a" 
	value="{{ a }}" />
   </p>

<p>Amazon will authorize you for an overall payment limit of  
	$<span id="limit_in_dollars">{{ limit_in_dollars }}</span>
	based on your weekly payment limits and the number of months between
	reauthorizations.  
	Remember, you can change how often you want to make payments or go
	back to adjust your weekly limits.
</p>
